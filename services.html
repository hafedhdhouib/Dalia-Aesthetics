                        <b>Organic Facial</b>

                        It may seem obvious, but the main difference between an organic facia l and a regular facial
                        is the ingredients used. The techniques are essentially the same, but organic facials use
                        organic skincare products. Organic ingredients can be part of Aqua facial for client who are
                        willing to do deep cleansing using organic range of products.
                        <b>Firming Facial</b>
                        Such treatment is useful to prevent the skin aging on the first stages and lift your face
                        shape. It can smooth little wrinkles and remove an old cornified layer. Because of current
                        irritation, derma gets an “alarm” signal and becomes toned. That why you can see the
                        immediate
                        result, which will stay for two-six days. Or longer after the finished course of
                        manipulations.

                        Galvanic therapy includes two steps of performing.

                        First, the aesthetician cleans dirty pores through a process called “DE incrustation”. The
                        highest attention should be paid to a “T-zone” of your face. The pouring of special gel with
                        negative ions forces skin cells to change their PH. While it is applied, the professional
                        will
                        perform deep cleansing with the use of devises, providing the low-level current. Under the
                        force of electrodes molecules of subcutaneous fat come out from pores and turns to a soap.
                        Which will be carefully and thoroughly removed from your skin without any pain or force.

                        The second part of the galvanic therapy should be performed after the deep cleansing to
                        nourish derma with an active complex of:

                        <ul>
                          <li>Vitamins;</li>
                          <li>Bio extracts;</li>
                          <li>Antioxidants;</li>
                          <li>Complicated amino acids, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        This process is called “iontophoresis”. Now the aesthetician applies another gel with an
                        opposite charged ions – positive. It is necessary to change the skin PH back to normal and
                        also fill your derma with the nutritious ingredients. Now it will permeate through the cells
                        and pores easily, calming the irritated cover.

                        How Does It Work: Microcurrent Facial
                        The microcurrent technique, as the galvanic, uses low-level electric waves, which permeate
                        into the face muscles. This one includes electrodes or special gloves, which can provide
                        current while the aesthetician performs massage. The main results and effects, which you can
                        expect after the procedure:

                        <ul>
                          <li>Lifted face and neck line</li>
                          <li>Calmed and smoothen skin</li>
                          <li>A brighten smooth texture</li>
                          <li>Nourished active cells, which renovate faster;</li>
                          <li>Improved blood circulation and intercellular exchange.</li>
                        </ul>
                        This method is effective to fight swelling and extra water in your derma. The ridding of it
                        mainly helps to tone and modify the face, neck and décolletage contour.

                        <b>Snow white Facial</b><br>
                        The new concept of whitening facial that controlling and down regulating all phases and
                        expressions of melanin production, It treats skin discolorations and pigmentation caused by
                        hormonal changes, post acne blemishes, environmental factors, UV exposure, and the natural
                        process of ageing.

                        The treatment steps start with basic deep pores cleansing and proper skin exfoliating
                        procedure besides light therapy as per skin requirement followed by applying special
                        whitening mask and nourishing brightening serum that help to lightening the spots and all
                        over brightening the skin. To avoid new pigmentation and control the existing problem the
                        client need to use pigment controlling home care besides the whitening treatment.

                          <li>SKIN REJUVENATION PEELS
                          </li>
                          <p>A chemical peel is a procedure in which a chemical solution is applied to the skin to
                            remove the top layers. The skin that grows back is smoother. With a light or medium peel,
                            you may need to undergo the procedure more than once to get the desired results.

                            Chemical peels are used to treat wrinkles, discolored skin and scars — usually on the face
                            as well as on the body areas. They can be done alone or combined with other cosmetic
                            procedures. And they can be done at different depths, from light to deep. Deeper chemical
                            peels offer more-dramatic results but also take longer to recover from.

                            Our skin rejuvenation peels treatment function is to restore skin’s natural vibrancy by
                            removing impurities and promoting cellular energy for skin that looks tired and strained.

                            A chemical peel is a skin-resurfacing procedure. Depending on the issues you're addressing
                            with the procedure, you'll choose a chemical peel in one of three depths:

                          <ul>
                            <li>Light chemical peel. A light (superficial) chemical peel removes the outer layer of
                              skin (epidermis). It's used to treat fine wrinkles, acne, uneven skin tone and dryness.
                              You might have a light peel every two weeks.</li>
                            <li> Medium chemical peel. A medium chemical peel removes skin cells from the epidermis
                              and from portions of the upper part of your middle layer of skin (dermis). It's used to
                              treat wrinkles, acne scars and uneven skin tone. You might need to repeat the procedure
                              to achieve or maintain the desired result.</li>
                            <li>Deep chemical peel. A deep chemical peel removes skin cells even deeper. Your doctor
                              might recommend one for deeper wrinkles, scars or precancerous growths. You won't need
                              repeat procedures to get the full effect.</li>
                          </ul>
                          Chemical peels can't remove deep scars or wrinkles or tighten sagging skin
                          <br>
                          Risks
                          <br>
                          A chemical peel can cause various side effects, including:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Redness, scabbing and swelling. Normal healing from a chemical peel involves redness of
                              the treated skin. After a medium or deep chemical peel, redness might last for a few
                              months.</li>
                            <li>Scarring. Rarely, a chemical peel can cause scarring — typically on the lower part of
                              the face. Antibiotics and steroid medications can be used to soften the appearance of
                              these scars.</li>
                            <li>Changes in skin color. A chemical peel can cause treated skin to become darker than
                              normal (hyperpigmentation) or lighter than normal (hypopigmentation). Hyperpigmentation is
                              more common after superficial peels, while hypopigmentation is more common after a deep
                              peel. These problems are more common in people with brown or black skin and can sometimes
                              be permanent.</li>
                            <li> Infection. A chemical peel can lead to a bacterial, fungal or viral infection, such as
                              a flare-up of the herpes virus — the virus that causes cold sores.</li>
                          </ul>
                          A chemical peel isn't for everyone. Your doctor might caution against a chemical peel or
                          certain types of chemical peels if you:

                          <ul>
                            <li>Have taken the oral acne medication isotretinoin in the past 4-6 months</li>
                            <li>Have a personal or family history of ridged areas caused by an overgrowth of scar tissue
                              (keloids)</li>
                            <li>Are pregnant</li>
                            <li>Have frequent or severe outbreaks of cold sores</li>
                          </ul>
                          Before you have a chemical peel, your doctor will likely:

                          <ul>
                            <li>Review your medical history. Be prepared to answer questions about current and past
                              medical conditions and any medications you are taking or have taken recently, as well as
                              any cosmetic procedures you've had.</li>
                            <li>Do a physical exam. Your doctor will inspect your skin and the area to be treated to
                              determine what type of peel you might benefit from most and how your physical features —
                              for example, the tone and thickness of your skin — might affect your results.</li>
                            <li>Discuss your expectations. Talk with your doctor about your motivations, expectations
                              and potential risks. Make sure you understand how many treatments you might need, how long
                              it'll take to heal and what your results might be.</li>
                          </ul>
                          Before your peel, you might also need to:

                          <ul>
                            <li>Take antiviral medication. Your doctor might prescribe an antiviral medication before
                              and after treatment to help prevent a viral infection.</li>
                            <li>Use a retinoid cream. Your doctor might recommend using a retinoid cream, such as
                              tretinoin (Retin-A) for a few weeks before treatment to help with healing.</li>
                            <li> Use a bleaching agent. Your doctor might recommend using a bleaching agent
                              (hydroquinone), a retinoid cream, or both before or after the procedure to reduce the risk
                              of side effects.</li>
                            <li>Avoid unprotected sun exposure. Too much sun exposure before the procedure can cause
                              permanent irregular pigmentation in treated areas. Discuss sun protection and acceptable
                              sun exposure with your doctor.</li>
                            <li> Avoid certain cosmetic treatments and certain types of hair removal. About a week
                              before the peel, stop using hair removal techniques such as electrolysis or depilatories.
                              Also, avoid hair dying treatments, permanent-wave or hair-straightening treatments, facial
                              masks, or facial scrubs in the week before your peel. Don't shave the areas that will be
                              treated beginning 24 hours before your peel.</li>
                          </ul>
                          Before the procedure
                          <br>
                          A chemical peel is usually done at an office or in an outpatient surgical facility. Before the
                          procedure, your doctor will clean your face, protect your hair, and cover your eyes with
                          ointment, gauze, tape or goggles.

                          Pain relief isn't typically needed for a light chemical peel. If you're having a medium peel,
                          you might receive a sedative and painkiller. For a deep peel, you might have a sedative,
                          something to numb the treatment area and fluids delivered through a vein.

                          During the procedure

                          During a light chemical peel:
                          <ul>
                            <li> Your doctor will use a brush, cotton ball, gauze or sponge to apply a chemical solution
                              typically containing glycolic acid or salicylic acid. The treated skin will begin to
                              whiten.</li>
                            <li>You might feel mild stinging while the chemical solution is on your skin.</li>
                            <li>Your doctor will apply a neutralizing solution or wash to remove the chemical solution
                              from the treated skin.</li>
                          </ul>
                          During a medium chemical peel:

                          <ul>
                            <li>Your doctor will use a cotton-tipped applicator or gauze to apply a chemical solution
                              containing trichloroacetic acid, sometimes in combination with glycolic acid. The treated
                              skin will begin to whiten.</li>
                            <li>After a few minutes, your doctor will apply cool compresses to soothe treated skin. You
                              might also be given a hand-held fan to cool your skin. No neutralizing solution is needed,
                              however.</li>
                            <li>You might feel stinging and burning for up to 20 minutes.</li>
                          </ul>
                          After the procedure <br>
                          After a chemical peel of any depth, your skin will be red, tight, irritated or swollen. Follow
                          your doctor's directions for sun protection, cleansing, moisturizing and applying protective
                          ointments to your skin. And avoid picking, rubbing or scratching your skin. It may take
                          several months before your skin color returns to normal and you can see the full results of
                          the peel.

                          After a light chemical peel, treated skin will be red, dry and mildly irritated — although
                          these effects might be less noticeable with each repeat treatment. Your doctor might apply a
                          protective ointment, such as petroleum jelly, to soothe the skin. You can usually wear makeup
                          the next day if you wish.

                          Treated areas take about one to seven days to heal after a light chemical peel. New skin might
                          temporarily be lighter or darker than normal.

                          After a medium chemical peel, treated skin will be red and swollen. You'll feel stinging. Your
                          doctor might apply a protective ointment, such as petroleum jelly, to soothe the area and
                          prevent dryness. After five to seven days, you can use cosmetics to cover any redness.

                          Use ice packs for comfort. Over-the-counter pain-relieving medication, such as ibuprofen may
                          help reduce any discomfort. You'll likely schedule a checkup soon after your treatment so that
                          your doctor can monitor your healing.

                          As swelling decreases, treated skin will begin to form a crust and might darken or develop
                          brown blotches. Treated areas take about seven to 14 days to heal after a medium chemical
                          peel, but redness might last for months.

                          After a deep chemical peel, you'll experience severe redness and swelling. You'll also feel
                          burning and throbbing, and the swelling may even make your eyelids swell shut.

                          Your doctor will apply a surgical dressing to treated skin. He or she might also prescribe
                          painkillers. You'll need to soak the treated skin and apply ointment several times a day for
                          about two weeks.

                          Treated areas will develop new skin within about two weeks after a deep chemical peel,
                          although redness might last for months. Treated skin might become darker or lighter than
                          normal or lose the ability to tan.

                          You might prefer to remain at home while you're healing from a chemical peel. You'll likely
                          need several follow-up visits soon after your treatment so that your doctor can monitor your
                          healing.

                          Once new skin completely covers the treated area in about two weeks, you can use cosmetics to
                          conceal any redness. Use sunscreen every day.

                          Results

                          A light chemical peel improves skin texture and tone and lessens the appearance of fine
                          wrinkles. The results are subtle but increase with repeated treatments. If you have a medium
                          chemical peel, treated skin will be noticeably smoother. After a deep chemical peel, you'll
                          see a dramatic improvement in the look and feel of treated areas. Results may not be
                          permanent. Over time, age and new sun damage can lead to new lines and skin color changes.

                          With all peels, the new skin is temporarily more sensitive to the sun. Talk with your doctor
                          about how long to protect your skin from the sun.
