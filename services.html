Under the force of electrodes molecules of subcutaneous fat come out from pores and turns to a soap. Which will be carefully and thoroughly removed from your skin without any pain or force.

  Vitamins;
  Bio extracts;
  Antioxidants;
  Complicated amino acids, etc.
  This process is called “iontophoresis”. Now the aesthetician applies another gel with an opposite charged ions – positive. It is necessary to change the skin PH back to normal and also fill your derma with the nutritious ingredients. Now it will permeate through the cells and pores easily, calming the irritated cover.

                        <li>A chemical peel</li>
<h5>A chemical peel is a procedure in which a chemical solution is applied to the skin to remove the top layers. The skin that grows back is smoother. With a light or medium peel, you may need to undergo the procedure more than once to get the desired results.

  Chemical peels are used to treat wrinkles, discolored skin and scars — usually on the face as well as on the body areas. They can be done alone or combined with other cosmetic procedures. And they can be done at different depths, from light to deep. Deeper chemical peels offer more-dramatic results but also take longer to recover from.
  
  Our skin rejuvenation peels treatment function is to restore skin’s natural vibrancy by removing impurities and promoting cellular energy for skin that looks tired and strained.
  
  A chemical peel is a skin-resurfacing procedure. Depending on the issues you're addressing with the procedure, you'll choose a chemical peel in one of three depths:
  
  ·       Light chemical peel. A light (superficial) chemical peel removes the outer layer of skin (epidermis). It's used to treat fine wrinkles, acne, uneven skin tone and dryness. You might have a light peel every two weeks.
  
  ·       Medium chemical peel. A medium chemical peel removes skin cells from the epidermis and from portions of the upper part of your middle layer of skin (dermis). It's used to treat wrinkles, acne scars and uneven skin tone. You might need to repeat the procedure to achieve or maintain the desired result.
  
  ·       Deep chemical peel. A deep chemical peel removes skin cells even deeper. Your doctor might recommend one for deeper wrinkles, scars or precancerous growths. You won't need repeat procedures to get the full effect.
  
  Chemical peels can't remove deep scars or wrinkles or tighten sagging skin
  
  Risks
  
  A chemical peel can cause various side effects, including:
  
  ·       Redness, scabbing and swelling. Normal healing from a chemical peel involves redness of the treated skin. After a medium or deep chemical peel, redness might last for a few months.
  
  ·       Scarring. Rarely, a chemical peel can cause scarring — typically on the lower part of the face. Antibiotics and steroid medications can be used to soften the appearance of these scars.
  
  ·       Changes in skin color. A chemical peel can cause treated skin to become darker than normal (hyperpigmentation) or lighter than normal (hypopigmentation). Hyperpigmentation is more common after superficial peels, while hypopigmentation is more common after a deep peel. These problems are more common in people with brown or black skin and can sometimes be permanent.
  
  ·       Infection. A chemical peel can lead to a bacterial, fungal or viral infection, such as a flare-up of the herpes virus — the virus that causes cold sores.
  
  A chemical peel isn't for everyone. Your doctor might caution against a chemical peel or certain types of chemical peels if you:
  
  ·       Have taken the oral acne medication isotretinoin in the past 4-6 months
  
  ·       Have a personal or family history of ridged areas caused by an overgrowth of scar tissue (keloids)
  
  ·       Are pregnant
  
  ·       Have frequent or severe outbreaks of cold sores
  
  Before you have a chemical peel, your doctor will likely:
  
  ·       Review your medical history. Be prepared to answer questions about current and past medical conditions and any medications you are taking or have taken recently, as well as any cosmetic procedures you've had.
  
  ·       Do a physical exam. Your doctor will inspect your skin and the area to be treated to determine what type of peel you might benefit from most and how your physical features — for example, the tone and thickness of your skin — might affect your results.
  
  ·       Discuss your expectations. Talk with your doctor about your motivations, expectations and potential risks. Make sure you understand how many treatments you might need, how long it'll take to heal and what your results might be.
  
  Before your peel, you might also need to:
  
  ·       Take antiviral medication. Your doctor might prescribe an antiviral medication before and after treatment to help prevent a viral infection.
  
  ·       Use a retinoid cream. Your doctor might recommend using a retinoid cream, such as tretinoin (Retin-A) for a few weeks before treatment to help with healing.
  
  ·       Use a bleaching agent. Your doctor might recommend using a bleaching agent (hydroquinone), a retinoid cream, or both before or after the procedure to reduce the risk of side effects.
  
  ·       Avoid unprotected sun exposure. Too much sun exposure before the procedure can cause permanent irregular pigmentation in treated areas. Discuss sun protection and acceptable sun exposure with your doctor.
  
  ·       Avoid certain cosmetic treatments and certain types of hair removal. About a week before the peel, stop using hair removal techniques such as electrolysis or depilatories. Also, avoid hair dying treatments, permanent-wave or hair-straightening treatments, facial masks, or facial scrubs in the week before your peel. Don't shave the areas that will be treated beginning 24 hours before your peel.
  
  Before the procedure
  
  A chemical peel is usually done at an office or in an outpatient surgical facility. Before the procedure, your doctor will clean your face, protect your hair, and cover your eyes with ointment, gauze, tape or goggles.
  
  Pain relief isn't typically needed for a light chemical peel. If you're having a medium peel, you might receive a sedative and painkiller. For a deep peel, you might have a sedative, something to numb the treatment area and fluids delivered through a vein.
  
  During the procedure
  
  During a light chemical peel:
  
  ·       Your doctor will use a brush, cotton ball, gauze or sponge to apply a chemical solution typically containing glycolic acid or salicylic acid. The treated skin will begin to whiten.
  
  ·       You might feel mild stinging while the chemical solution is on your skin.
  
  ·       Your doctor will apply a neutralizing solution or wash to remove the chemical solution from the treated skin.
  
  During a medium chemical peel:
  
  ·       Your doctor will use a cotton-tipped applicator or gauze to apply a chemical solution containing trichloroacetic acid, sometimes in combination with glycolic acid. The treated skin will begin to whiten.
  
  ·       After a few minutes, your doctor will apply cool compresses to soothe treated skin. You might also be given a hand-held fan to cool your skin. No neutralizing solution is needed, however.
  
  ·       You might feel stinging and burning for up to 20 minutes.
  
  After the procedure
  
  After a chemical peel of any depth, your skin will be red, tight, irritated or swollen. Follow your doctor's directions for sun protection, cleansing, moisturizing and applying protective ointments to your skin. And avoid picking, rubbing or scratching your skin. It may take several months before your skin color returns to normal and you can see the full results of the peel.
  
  After a light chemical peel, treated skin will be red, dry and mildly irritated — although these effects might be less noticeable with each repeat treatment. Your doctor might apply a protective ointment, such as petroleum jelly, to soothe the skin. You can usually wear makeup the next day if you wish.
  
  Treated areas take about one to seven days to heal after a light chemical peel. New skin might temporarily be lighter or darker than normal.
  
  After a medium chemical peel, treated skin will be red and swollen. You'll feel stinging. Your doctor might apply a protective ointment, such as petroleum jelly, to soothe the area and prevent dryness. After five to seven days, you can use cosmetics to cover any redness.
  
  Use ice packs for comfort. Over-the-counter pain-relieving medication, such as ibuprofen may help reduce any discomfort. You'll likely schedule a checkup soon after your treatment so that your doctor can monitor your healing.
  
  As swelling decreases, treated skin will begin to form a crust and might darken or develop brown blotches. Treated areas take about seven to 14 days to heal after a medium chemical peel, but redness might last for months.
  
  After a deep chemical peel, you'll experience severe redness and swelling. You'll also feel burning and throbbing, and the swelling may even make your eyelids swell shut.
  
  Your doctor will apply a surgical dressing to treated skin. He or she might also prescribe painkillers. You'll need to soak the treated skin and apply ointment several times a day for about two weeks.
  
  Treated areas will develop new skin within about two weeks after a deep chemical peel, although redness might last for months. Treated skin might become darker or lighter than normal or lose the ability to tan.
  
  You might prefer to remain at home while you're healing from a chemical peel. You'll likely need several follow-up visits soon after your treatment so that your doctor can monitor your healing.
  
  Once new skin completely covers the treated area in about two weeks, you can use cosmetics to conceal any redness. Use sunscreen every day.
  
  Results
  
  A light chemical peel improves skin texture and tone and lessens the appearance of fine wrinkles. The results are subtle but increase with repeated treatments. If you have a medium chemical peel, treated skin will be noticeably smoother. After a deep chemical peel, you'll see a dramatic improvement in the look and feel of treated areas. Results may not be permanent. Over time, age and new sun damage can lead to new lines and skin color changes.
  
  With all peels, the new skin is temporarily more sensitive to the sun. Talk with your doctor about how long to protect your skin from the sun.

  <li>SKIN BOOSTER & MESOTHERAPY</li>
<h5>Mesotherapy engages painless micro-injections of vitamins, minerals, besides hyaluronic and amino acids, the technique uses very fine needles to deliver a series of injections into the middle layer (mesoderm) of skin. The idea behind mesotherapy is that it corrects underlying issues like poor circulation and inflammation that cause skin damage. There isn’t a standard formula for the substances injected in mesotherapy. Doctors use many different solutions, like manual injections, nano-pore micro-needling, gold stamp, and meso-gun.

  Skin Boosters line brings you the revolution in cosmetology science and assures our commitment to providing you with high-end, top-quality products, capable of maximising efficacy with a safe and natural way. The characteristic advantage of the line is that its products are in fact “skin boosters”: products with dynamic, complex and technologically advanced formulas, which boost and enhance the natural processes and functions of the skin. Skin boosters are the bolus dose of concentrated ingredients given to the client via injectable & non injectable technique that helps the aging and damaged skin to return to their normal function over 30-60 days. The booster’s main ingredients are high concentration of hyaluronic acid, growth factors and amino acids that correct the structure of the dermis and give proper hydration.
  
   
  </h5>
  <li>CARBON DIOXIDE GAS THERAPY</li>
<h5>Carboxy therapy is a minimally invasive, injected temporary procedure utilizing a fine needle to place carbon dioxide gas directly into skin & subcutaneous tissue (fat cells). The carbon dioxide encourages the body to send additional blood to the area improving circulation and rejuvenating tissues.

  Carboxytherapy is used to treat scars, loose skin, cellulite, dark under-eye circles, and stretch marks. People who undergo the procedure find an improvement in:
  
  circulation
  skin elasticity
  fine lines and wrinkles
  It also aids with collagen repair and the destruction of fatty deposits.
  
  Additionally, it can help reduce under-eye circles by increasing blood flow to the eyelid. Some physicians have also used the therapy to treat erectile dysfunction, acute arthritis, Raynaud’s syndrome, and alopecia caused by poor blood circulation.
  
  For fat and cellulite reduction, the procedure is often preferred over more invasive and high-risk methods, like liposuction. It can treat different parts of the face &  body skin and cellulite.

  CELL THERAPY
</li>
<h5>
  Platelet-rich plasma consists of two elements: plasma, or the liquid portion of blood, and platelets, a type of blood cell that plays an important role in healing throughout the body. Platelets are well-known for their clotting abilities, but they also contain growth factors that can trigger cell reproduction and stimulate tissue regeneration or healing in the treated area. Platelet-rich plasma is simply blood that contains more platelets than normal.

To create platelet-rich plasma, clinicians take a blood sample from the patient and place it into a device called a centrifuge that rapidly spins the sample, separating out the other components of the blood from the platelets and concentrating them within the plasma.

The mechanism behind PRP injections is not completely understood. Studies show that the increased concentration of growth factors in platelet-rich plasma may stimulate or speed up the healing process and speed up baby skin to be mature and differentiate in to new skin and that will help to repair and rejuvenate the skin and other body parts. For aesthetic treatments, It can be used as rejuvenation skin treatment or can be also combined with other treatments for skin problems that needs repairing like scarring and aging problems.

A PRP injection is a low-risk procedure and does not usually cause major side effects. The procedure involves a blood draw, so you should make sure you are hydrated and have eaten beforehand to prevent feeling lightheaded. After the procedure, you may experience some soreness and bruising at the injection site.

Because PRP injections are made up of your own cells and plasma, the risk of an allergic reaction is much lower than with other injectable medications.

<li>MICRODERMABBRASION</li>
<h5>It is a skin rejuvenation procedure that helps you to fight the unwanted effects of aging. It may also replace a day in spa by its result. Some of the high-tech skin products need to penetrate deeply into your skin. So, they stimulate the process of building collagen by your body. Our treatment involves the usage of manual exfoliation to remove an outer layer of the skin. A series of this cosmetic procedures is enough to achieve the best effect. A unique and miraculous diamond tipped wand cleans the skin surface, make it toned and soft.

  The entire process of microdermabrasion procedure takes about 30 minutes. This treatment helps to reduce the face wrinkles, minimize the pores and diminish sun damage, making skin texture smoother. Microdermabrasion also provides toning and firming of your complexion by boosting up the collagen production. We can achieve even bigger outcome due to combining the procedure with different kinds of chemical peel.
  
   
  
  The Diamond Microdermabrasion treatment involves following steps:
  
  Cleansing in an appropriate way depending on your individual skin condition and type;
  Using the microdermabrasion wand over skin in a smooth fashion;
  Applying a special hydrating mask on the toned face cover;
  Gentle massage;
  In the end, the skin will be moisturized by professional remedies.
  The Important Benefits of Microdermabrasion:
  Diminish sun damage
  Reduce the amount of uneven pigmentation spots
  Weaken open and closed comedones, remove black dots
  Decrease fine lines and wrinkles or age spots
  Lessen large and wide pores, textured skin
  Stimulate cell metabolism
  Polishes acne scars, making them less visible and deep
  </h5>
<li>SKIN MICRO-NEEDLING RADIOFREQUENCY</li>
<h5>A unique and emerging facial rejuvenation option that uses either a RF machine or dermal puncture with radio frequency to impart micro perforations on the skin. This improves the appearance pigmentations, wrinkles, scars, pores, stretchmarks and uneven skin tone and results in a smoother, firmer and younger looking skin.

  How does Fractional Radiofrequency (RF) for skin rejuvenation work?
  
  A specialized portable hand piece with micro-pins is used to penetrate the skin. Radiofrequency then flows through the pins to deliver thermal energy to deeper layers of the skin promoting the body’s natural healing process. It works exclusively in the target areas, emitting energy to minimally ablate the skin and heat it spot by spot without affecting the surrounding areas. These actions stimulate the production of new collagen and generally improve any blemishes or pigmentation and address texture concerns.
  
  Is the treatment painful? Is it safe? How long will the treatment take?
  
  You will feel the heat and the treatment may not be comfortable but not necessarily painful. When requested, a topical anesthesia is applied to ensure safety and comfort throughout the procedure. Fractional Radiofrequency usually takes between 20-45 minutes, depending in the treatment area.
  
   
  
  How many treatments I need before I see results and how long will it stay?
  
   
  
  Immediate rejuvenation is observed after the treatment and is expected to get better in the next few days. We recommend 3-6 treatments with 4 weeks interval.

                        Chemical Peels
                        Chemical Peels serve as the first line of defense against acne scars. A diluted acidic solution of specific strength is applied to the facial skin. This helps remove the outermost, damaged layer of the skin and also boosts collagen levels. However, chemical peels are useful for mild acne scarring only.
                        
                        Microdermabrasion
                        Microdermabrasion is a simple acne scar removal treatment that uses a sandblaster-like machine to buff away the top layer of the skin. Moreover, it polishes the affected areas and stimulates the growth of new skin free of scars and acne blemishes. The procedure also boosts the collagen levels to counter the scarring caused by acne.
                        
                        Fractional Radiofrequency Treatment (RFT)
                        Radiofrequency treatment for acne scars involves the use of pulsed waves with micro-needles that help create new skin. Moreover, the RFT waves heat collagen in the inner layers of your skin, resulting in shrinkage and tightening of the skin. It also stimulates the production of collagen in your skin as well as new and youthful skin. This treatment in combined with special mesotherapy cocktail for acne scaring will maximize the results of healing at the margins of the scars and the scars will looks much smaller and shallower.
                        
                        Laser Skin Resurfacing/Fractional Laser
                        Laser Skin Resurfacing is probably the most commonly used procedure for removing acne scars. During this procedure, a high-intensity laser beam is used to create microscopic wounds in the outermost skin layer, inducing self-healing. This boosts both collagen and elastin levels and allows a newer, healthier layer of skin to replace the scarred one.
                        
                        Pre-Treatment Care
                        Patients must follow some pre-procedure guidelines before Acne Scars Treatment. Some general guidelines are as follows:

                        Have a good night’s sleep on the day before the treatment.
                        Do not apply any cream or lotion to the face on the day of treatment.
                        Post-Treatment Care
                        Patients must follow certain post-treatment instructions given by their practitioner. Some general post-procedural instructions are as follows:
                        
                        Use ice packs to relieve any discomfort, pain, or itchiness.
                        Avoid exposing the treated areas to direct sunlight for 4 to 6 weeks at least.
                        Keep the face generously moisturized to avoid any itching sensations.

<li>AGING SIGNS & BOTOX</li>
<h5>
  For women and men alike, looking young and healthy for as long as possible is very desirable. Genetics play a role in how we all age, but lifestyle choices are also a major factor that cause some people to age must faster than others. By being able to detect the early signs of aging, it is possible to work towards slowing the aging process. There are many treatments available that can rejuvenate skin and help it maintain its elasticity and youthful glow for much longer. When signs of aging have already become quite apparent, there is no need to worry. More intensive procedures and modern technology can work wonders even with deep wrinkles and other more noticeable signs of aging. Below are the main signs of aging to look out for and how to manage them.
  
  Signs of aging include:
  
  ·       Dullness
  
  ·       Roughness
  
  ·       Uneven skin tone
  
  ·       Discoloration such as brown and red spots
  
  ·       Loss of skin elasticity and volume
  </h5>
  <li>
    FINE LINES AND WRINKLES
  </li>
  <h5>Fine lines are extremely common under the eyes, around the mouth and across the forehead. Usually first showing up in a person’s early twenties, these lines can become deeper and more noticeable over time. Of course, they appear in the first place due to making common facial expression such as smiling or frowning. In fact, frowning causes more areas on your face to move and can reinforce wrinkles much faster than smiling will. Although fine lines and wrinkles are a normal part of aging, they don’t have to become a main feature of your face. Often, good habits such as wearing sunscreen, removing makeup at night, and drinking enough water are enough to slow their development. However, if you already have good habits and you are noticing crow’s feet and deep lines around your mouth every time you laugh or smile, adding Botox to your beauty regime can prevent these areas from creasing further. Botox works by relaxing the muscles that cause wrinkles so that the skin can smooth out on its own. For deeper wrinkles around the mouth or on the forehead, Resurfacing Skin treatments & boosters are good choices to tighten the skin and refining the lines & wrinkles. Also rejuvenating & bio stimulating Fillers are injected under the skin to help support the skin on your face so that wrinkles are less prominent.</h5>
<li>ELASTICITY AND HYDRATION</li>
<h5>
  Over time, skin naturally becomes less elastic and can be prone to sagging. Common areas for facial sagging are under the chin and the cheek area along with the sides of the face. The reason why skin becomes less elastic as we age is due to the loss of collagen and elastin. Younger people naturally produce more of both, but eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly can help your body continue to produce collagen and elastin for longer. Of course, drinking enough water also helps keep your skin plump and healthy and can prevent sagging. Dehydrated skin is also prone to wrinkles and dryness, both of which can make you look older. There are numerous creams available to help promote collagen and elastin in your skin, but once sagging has already happened, non-surgical & surgical procedures are usually the best option to regain a youthful appearance. In some cases, sagging in the face is caused by rapid weight gain and loss. A rhytidectomy, more commonly known as a facelift, can tighten the skin and reduce the appearance of wrinkles at the same time.
</h5>
<li>SUN DAMAGE AND AGE SPOTS</li>
<h5>
  After many summers enjoying the beautiful weather, our skin pays the price. Every time we get a tan or sunburn, the skin is damaged slightly and needs excellent nutrition and hydration to recover. Some damage from the sun will be permanent. Sun damage usually causes dryness or peeling, which can exacerbate wrinkles and will speed up their development. Dark spots are also a result of sun damage, known as hyperpigmentation. This occurs when the melanin produced by our skin makes certain areas appear darker in a permanent way, which can cause a person to look older. Laser skin treatments can help remove these dark spots.
  </h5>
  <li>
    SKIN TONE
  </li>
  <h5>As people age, their body replaces skin cells less and less frequently. As a result, damaged skin is not repaired as quickly and damage and wrinkles become more prominent. Skin tone can also become dull and dry looking since old cells are not replaced by new ones as frequently. This is why it is important to take better care of our skin as we age. Procedures such as microdermabrasion and laser therapy can cause new skin cells to generate, which greatly improves skin tone. Healthy skin cells are sure to give your face that youthful glow you have been missing.
    By noticing the seven signs of ageing, making lifestyle changes is possible. For any damage that simple hydration and improved daily choices cannot fix, there are minimally invasive procedures that can help your skin look its best.
    
    The gold standard in improving a sagging face and deep wrinkles is a facelift, but injections can still have impressive results in the meantime.
    </h5>
    <li>FACE TIGHTENING & LIFTING</li>
    <h5>
      When you’re born, your skin is rich with proteins called elastin and collagen. These proteins give your skin structure and elasticity. As you age, your body’s production of these proteins slows down. As a result, your skin starts to lose its elasticity.
      
      Thanks to gravity, pollution exposure, stress, and the hundreds of movements that your facial muscles make every day, your skin might start to appear stretched or saggy. Other factors, such as pregnancy and weight loss, can also contribute to stretch marks and sagging skin.
      
      Nonsurgical skin tightening & Lifting treatments target areas of your skin that have become loose and stimulate collagen production underneath that skin.
      
      Nonsurgical skin tightening procedures are cosmetic treatments to change quality of your skin texture and elasticity. That can be achieved by applying aesthetic energy devices on the facial skin and raise temperature of dermis to more that 45 degree to stimulated more collagen & elastin.
      
      While Non- surgical face lifting procedures are aesthetic treatments that raise position of skin to upper lifted places compare to before and that can be achieved by applying high energy waves that reaches under skin to SMAS layer ( superficial musculoaponeurotic system) and created thermal wounds & later fibrous bands that hold & lift the skin up.
      
      These procedures are far less invasive than surgical options, like facelifts  and some people claim they can produce similar results. There are also fewer complication risks, it’s less expensive, and recovery is simple.
      
      These treatments are based on newer technologies. That means that there’s still a gap in research to understand how effective they are, and what the long-term side effects might be.
      
      Treatment options which can help to tight & lift the saggy skin without surgery are:
      
       
      
      Radiofrequency (RF) therapy RINNOVA, also called radiofrequency skin tightening, is a nonsurgical method of tightening your skin with monopolar & bipolar RF waves are a form of radiation. Radiation is the release of energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. The procedure involves using energy waves to heat the deep layer of your skin known as your dermis. This heat stimulates the production of collagen. Collagen is the most common protein in your body. It creates the framework of your skin and gives your skin its firmness. RF therapy has been used since 2001 to fight against sagging skin and signs of aging, RF waves heat the deep layer of your skin to between 122 and 167°F (50–75°C). Studies have found that maintaining a temperature over 115°F (46°C) for over 3 minutes causes your body to release heat-shock proteins. These proteins stimulate your body to create new collagen fibers. The procedure normally takes less than an hour and should be nearly painless. Potential benefits of RF therapy are tightening your skin in the face & body and getting rid of fine lines & wrinkles. However, RF therapy may also help fight sun damage due to its ability stimulate the production of collagen.
      
      At the start of the treatment the practitioner will attach a grounding pad on your back, thigh or shoulder so that the radio frequency energy can go back to the device once it has entered your body. They will then apply a get to the area to be treated which will help the handpiece to move on your skin.
      
      The time taken for a treatment session will depend upon the size of the area and indication being treated, for example a small area on the face and neck could take around 20 minutes, whilst a large area on the thighs and saddle bags could take up to 60 minutes.
      
       
      
      Four six sessions at a rate of once every 1-2 weeks are recommended, although more treatments can be administered if required. Results are usually seen within two to three months but skin will continue to improve for up to six months. Maintenance treatment may be required.
      
      HIFU is a non-surgical and non-invasive facelift that uses ultrasound waves for tightening and lifting the skin. It uses high-intensity focused ultrasound to revive and rejuvenate the skin. The high-intensity ultrasound bypasses the skin’s surface and penetrates its inner layer. It directs ultrasound energy, particularly into the deep tissues and muscles where collagen is produced. Due to the energy, collagen starts reviving, and as a result, the skin tissue becomes rejuvenated.
      
      It is the only non-invasive technique approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to lift facial and neck skin. Moreover, it is excellent for lifting the skin under the chin as well as on the eyebrows. The FDA has also approved this treatment for removing fine lines and wrinkles from the following body parts:
      
      Face & neck, shoulders, back, chest
