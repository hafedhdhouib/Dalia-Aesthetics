                          Platelet-rich plasma consists of two elements: plasma, or the liquid portion of blood, and
                          platelets, a type of blood cell that plays an important role in healing throughout the body.
                          Platelets are well-known for their clotting abilities, but they also contain growth factors
                          that
                          can trigger cell reproduction and stimulate tissue regeneration or healing in the treated
                          area.
                          .Platelet-rich plasma is simply blood that contains more platelets than normal
                          To create platelet-rich plasma, clinicians take a blood sample from the patient and place it
                          into a device called a centrifuge that rapidly spins the sample, separating out the other
                          .components of the blood from the platelets and concentrating them within the plasma
                          The mechanism behind PRP injections is not completely understood. Studies show that the

                          the healing process and speed up baby skin to be mature and differentiate to new skin and
                          that will help to repair and rejuvenate the skin and other body parts. For aesthetic

                        <h5>It is a skin rejuvenation procedure that helps you to fight the unwanted effects of aging. It
                          may also replace a day in spa by its result. Some of the high-tech skin products need to
                          penetrate deeply into your skin. So, they stimulate the process of building collagen by your
                          body. Our treatment involves the usage of manual exfoliation to remove an outer layer of the
                          skin. A series of those cosmetic procedures is enough to achieve the best effect. A unique
                          .and miraculous diamond tipped wand cleans the skin surface, makes it toned and soft
                          The entire process of microdermabrasion procedure takes about 30 minutes. This treatment
                          helps to reduce the face wrinkles, minimize the pores and diminish sun damage, making skin
                          texture smoother. Microdermabrasion also provides toning and firming of your complexion by
                          boosting up the collagen production. We can achieve this even bigger outcome due to
                          .combining the procedure with different kinds of chemical peel</h5>

                      <p>A unique and emerging facial rejuvenation option that uses either a RF machine or dermal
                        puncture with radio frequency to impart micro perforations on the skin. This improves the
                        appearance pigmentations, wrinkles, scars, pores, stretchmarks and uneven skin tone and

                        ?How does Fractional Radiofrequency (RF) for skin rejuvenation work
                        A specialized portable hand piece with micro-pins is used to penetrate the skin.
                        Radiofrequency then flows through the pins to deliver thermal energy to deeper layers of the
                        skin promoting the body’s natural healing process. It works exclusively in the target areas,
                        emitting energy to minimally ablate the skin and heat it spot by spot without affecting the
                        surrounding areas. These actions stimulate the production of new collagen and generally
                        .improve any blemishes or pigmentation and address texture concerns</p>
