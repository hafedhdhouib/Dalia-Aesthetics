                  <b>Organic Facial</b>

                  It may seem obvious, but the main difference between an organic facia l and a regular facial
                  is the ingredients used. The techniques are essentially the same, but organic facials use
                  organic skincare products. Organic ingredients can be part of Aqua facial for client who are
                  willing to do deep cleansing using organic range of products.
                  <b>Firming Facial</b>
                  Such treatment is useful to prevent the skin aging on the first stages and lift your face
                  shape. It can smooth little wrinkles and remove an old cornified layer. Because of current
                  irritation, derma gets an “alarm” signal and becomes toned. That why you can see the
                  immediate
                  result, which will stay for two-six days. Or longer after the finished course of
                  manipulations.

                  Galvanic therapy includes two steps of performing.

                  First, the aesthetician cleans dirty pores through a process called “DE incrustation”. The
                  highest attention should be paid to a “T-zone” of your face. The pouring of special gel with
                  negative ions forces skin cells to change their PH. While it is applied, the professional
                  will
                  perform deep cleansing with the use of devises, providing the low-level current. Under the
                  force of electrodes molecules of subcutaneous fat come out from pores and turns to a soap.
                  Which will be carefully and thoroughly removed from your skin without any pain or force.

                  The second part of the galvanic therapy should be performed after the deep cleansing to
                  nourish derma with an active complex of:

                  <ul>
                    <li>Vitamins;</li>
                    <li>Bio extracts;</li>
                    <li>Antioxidants;</li>
                    <li>Complicated amino acids, etc.</li>
                  </ul>
                  This process is called “iontophoresis”. Now the aesthetician applies another gel with an
                  opposite charged ions – positive. It is necessary to change the skin PH back to normal and
                  also fill your derma with the nutritious ingredients. Now it will permeate through the cells
                  and pores easily, calming the irritated cover.

                  How Does It Work: Microcurrent Facial
                  The microcurrent technique, as the galvanic, uses low-level electric waves, which permeate
                  into the face muscles. This one includes electrodes or special gloves, which can provide
                  current while the aesthetician performs massage. The main results and effects, which you can
                  expect after the procedure:

                  <ul>
                    <li>Lifted face and neck line</li>
                    <li>Calmed and smoothen skin</li>
                    <li>A brighten smooth texture</li>
                    <li>Nourished active cells, which renovate faster;</li>
                    <li>Improved blood circulation and intercellular exchange.</li>
                  </ul>
                  This method is effective to fight swelling and extra water in your derma. The ridding of it
                  mainly helps to tone and modify the face, neck and décolletage contour.

                  <b>Snow white Facial</b><br>
                  The new concept of whitening facial that controlling and down regulating all phases and
                  expressions of melanin production, It treats skin discolorations and pigmentation caused by
                  hormonal changes, post acne blemishes, environmental factors, UV exposure, and the natural
                  process of ageing.

                  The treatment steps start with basic deep pores cleansing and proper skin exfoliating
                  procedure besides light therapy as per skin requirement followed by applying special
                  whitening mask and nourishing brightening serum that help to lightening the spots and all
                  over brightening the skin. To avoid new pigmentation and control the existing problem the
                  client need to use pigment controlling home care besides the whitening treatment.
