          <h1>Skin peels</h1>
          <p>A chemical peel is a procedure in which a chemical solution is applied to the skin to
            remove the top layers. The skin that grows back is smoother. With a light or medium peel,
            you may need to undergo the procedure more than once to get the desired results.
  
            Chemical peels are used to treat wrinkles, discolored skin and scars — usually on the face
            as well as on the body areas. They can be done alone or combined with other cosmetic
            procedures. And they can be done at different depths, from light to deep. Deeper chemical
            peels offer more-dramatic results but also take longer to recover from.
  
            Our skin rejuvenation peels treatment function is to restore skin’s natural vibrancy by
            removing impurities and promoting cellular energy for skin that looks tired and strained.
  
            A chemical peel is a skin-resurfacing procedure. Depending on the issues you're addressing
            with the procedure, you'll choose a chemical peel in one of three depths:
  
          <ul>
            <li>Light chemical peel. A light (superficial) chemical peel removes the outer layer of
              skin (epidermis). It's used to treat fine wrinkles, acne, uneven skin tone and dryness.
              You might have a light peel every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Medium chemical peel. A medium chemical peel removes skin cells from the epidermis
              and from portions of the upper part of your middle layer of skin (dermis). It's used to
              treat wrinkles, acne scars and uneven skin tone. You might need to repeat the procedure
              to achieve or maintain the desired result.</li>
            <li>Deep chemical peel. A deep chemical peel removes skin cells even deeper. Your doctor
              might recommend one for deeper wrinkles, scars or precancerous growths. You won't need
              repeat procedures to get the full effect.</li>
          </ul>
          Chemical peels can't remove deep scars or wrinkles or tighten sagging skin
          <br>
          Risks
          <br>
          A chemical peel can cause various side effects, including:
          <ul>
            <li>Redness, scabbing and swelling. Normal healing from a chemical peel involves redness of
              the treated skin. After a medium or deep chemical peel, redness might last for a few
              months.</li>
            <li>Scarring. Rarely, a chemical peel can cause scarring — typically on the lower part of
              the face. Antibiotics and steroid medications can be used to soften the appearance of
              these scars.</li>
            <li>Changes in skin color. A chemical peel can cause treated skin to become darker than
              normal (hyperpigmentation) or lighter than normal (hypopigmentation). Hyperpigmentation is
              more common after superficial peels, while hypopigmentation is more common after a deep
              peel. These problems are more common in people with brown or black skin and can sometimes
              be permanent.</li>
            <li> Infection. A chemical peel can lead to a bacterial, fungal or viral infection, such as
              a flare-up of the herpes virus — the virus that causes cold sores.</li>
          </ul>
          A chemical peel isn't for everyone. Your doctor might caution against a chemical peel or
          certain types of chemical peels if you:
  
          <ul>
            <li>Have taken the oral acne medication isotretinoin in the past 4-6 months</li>
            <li>Have a personal or family history of ridged areas caused by an overgrowth of scar tissue
              (keloids)</li>
            <li>Are pregnant</li>
            <li>Have frequent or severe outbreaks of cold sores</li>
          </ul>
          Before you have a chemical peel, your doctor will likely:
  
          <ul>
            <li>Review your medical history. Be prepared to answer questions about current and past
              medical conditions and any medications you are taking or have taken recently, as well as
              any cosmetic procedures you've had.</li>
            <li>Do a physical exam. Your doctor will inspect your skin and the area to be treated to
              determine what type of peel you might benefit from most and how your physical features —
              for example, the tone and thickness of your skin — might affect your results.</li>
            <li>Discuss your expectations. Talk with your doctor about your motivations, expectations
              and potential risks. Make sure you understand how many treatments you might need, how long
              it'll take to heal and what your results might be.</li>
          </ul>
          Before your peel, you might also need to:
  
          <ul>
            <li>Take antiviral medication. Your doctor might prescribe an antiviral medication before
              and after treatment to help prevent a viral infection.</li>
            <li>Use a retinoid cream. Your doctor might recommend using a retinoid cream, such as
              tretinoin (Retin-A) for a few weeks before treatment to help with healing.</li>
            <li> Use a bleaching agent. Your doctor might recommend using a bleaching agent
              (hydroquinone), a retinoid cream, or both before or after the procedure to reduce the risk
              of side effects.</li>
            <li>Avoid unprotected sun exposure. Too much sun exposure before the procedure can cause
              permanent irregular pigmentation in treated areas. Discuss sun protection and acceptable
              sun exposure with your doctor.</li>
            <li> Avoid certain cosmetic treatments and certain types of hair removal. About a week
              before the peel, stop using hair removal techniques such as electrolysis or depilatories.
              Also, avoid hair dying treatments, permanent-wave or hair-straightening treatments, facial
              masks, or facial scrubs in the week before your peel. Don't shave the areas that will be
              treated beginning 24 hours before your peel.</li>
          </ul>
          Before the procedure
          <br>
          A chemical peel is usually done at an office or in an outpatient surgical facility. Before the
          procedure, your doctor will clean your face, protect your hair, and cover your eyes with
          ointment, gauze, tape or goggles.
  
          Pain relief isn't typically needed for a light chemical peel. If you're having a medium peel,
          you might receive a sedative and painkiller. For a deep peel, you might have a sedative,
          something to numb the treatment area and fluids delivered through a vein.
  
          During the procedure
  
          During a light chemical peel:
          <ul>
            <li> Your doctor will use a brush, cotton ball, gauze or sponge to apply a chemical solution
              typically containing glycolic acid or salicylic acid. The treated skin will begin to
              whiten.</li>
            <li>You might feel mild stinging while the chemical solution is on your skin.</li>
            <li>Your doctor will apply a neutralizing solution or wash to remove the chemical solution
              from the treated skin.</li>
          </ul>
          During a medium chemical peel:
  
          <ul>
            <li>Your doctor will use a cotton-tipped applicator or gauze to apply a chemical solution
              containing trichloroacetic acid, sometimes in combination with glycolic acid. The treated
              skin will begin to whiten.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, your doctor will apply cool compresses to soothe treated skin. You
              might also be given a hand-held fan to cool your skin. No neutralizing solution is needed,
              however.</li>
            <li>You might feel stinging and burning for up to 20 minutes.</li>
          </ul>
          After the procedure <br>
          After a chemical peel of any depth, your skin will be red, tight, irritated or swollen. Follow
          your doctor's directions for sun protection, cleansing, moisturizing and applying protective
          ointments to your skin. And avoid picking, rubbing or scratching your skin. It may take
          several months before your skin color returns to normal and you can see the full results of
          the peel.
  
          After a light chemical peel, treated skin will be red, dry and mildly irritated — although
          these effects might be less noticeable with each repeat treatment. Your doctor might apply a
          protective ointment, such as petroleum jelly, to soothe the skin. You can usually wear makeup
          the next day if you wish.
  
          Treated areas take about one to seven days to heal after a light chemical peel. New skin might
          temporarily be lighter or darker than normal.
  
          After a medium chemical peel, treated skin will be red and swollen. You'll feel stinging. Your
          doctor might apply a protective ointment, such as petroleum jelly, to soothe the area and
          prevent dryness. After five to seven days, you can use cosmetics to cover any redness.
  
          Use ice packs for comfort. Over-the-counter pain-relieving medication, such as ibuprofen may
          help reduce any discomfort. You'll likely schedule a checkup soon after your treatment so that
          your doctor can monitor your healing.
  
          As swelling decreases, treated skin will begin to form a crust and might darken or develop
          brown blotches. Treated areas take about seven to 14 days to heal after a medium chemical
          peel, but redness might last for months.
  
          After a deep chemical peel, you'll experience severe redness and swelling. You'll also feel
          burning and throbbing, and the swelling may even make your eyelids swell shut.
  
          Your doctor will apply a surgical dressing to treated skin. He or she might also prescribe
          painkillers. You'll need to soak the treated skin and apply ointment several times a day for
          about two weeks.
  
          Treated areas will develop new skin within about two weeks after a deep chemical peel,
          although redness might last for months. Treated skin might become darker or lighter than
          normal or lose the ability to tan.
  
          You might prefer to remain at home while you're healing from a chemical peel. You'll likely
          need several follow-up visits soon after your treatment so that your doctor can monitor your
          healing.
  
          Once new skin completely covers the treated area in about two weeks, you can use cosmetics to
          conceal any redness. Use sunscreen every day.
  
          Results
  
          A light chemical peel improves skin texture and tone and lessens the appearance of fine
          wrinkles. The results are subtle but increase with repeated treatments. If you have a medium
          chemical peel, treated skin will be noticeably smoother. After a deep chemical peel, you'll
          see a dramatic improvement in the look and feel of treated areas. Results may not be
          permanent. Over time, age and new sun damage can lead to new lines and skin color changes.
  
          With all peels, the new skin is temporarily more sensitive to the sun. Talk with your doctor
          about how long to protect your skin from the sun. <br>
          <b>SKIN BOOSTER & MESOTHERAPY</b>
  <br>
          Mesotherapy engages painless micro-injections of vitamins, minerals, besides hyaluronic and amino acids, the
          technique uses very fine needles to deliver a series of injections into the middle layer (mesoderm) of skin. The
          idea behind mesotherapy is that it corrects underlying issues like poor circulation and inflammation that cause
          skin damage. There isn’t a standard formula for the substances injected in mesotherapy. Doctors use many
          different solutions, like manual injections, nano-pore micro-needling, gold stamp, and meso-gun.
  
          Skin Boosters line brings you the revolution in cosmetology science and assures our commitment to providing you
          with high-end, top-quality products, capable of maximising efficacy with a safe and natural way. The
          characteristic advantage of the line is that its products are in fact “skin boosters”: products with dynamic,
          complex and technologically advanced formulas, which boost and enhance the natural processes and functions of
          the skin. Skin boosters are the bolus dose of concentrated ingredients given to the client via injectable & non
          injectable technique that helps the aging and damaged skin to return to their normal function over 30-60 days.
          The booster’s main ingredients are high concentration of hyaluronic acid, growth factors and amino acids that
          correct the structure of the dermis and give proper hydration. <br>
          <b>CARBON DIOXIDE GAS THERAPY</b> <br>
          <b>Carboxy therapy</b>is a minimally invasive, injected temporary procedure utilizing a fine needle to place
          carbon dioxide gas directly into skin & subcutaneous tissue (fat cells). The carbon dioxide encourages the body
          to send additional blood to the area improving circulation and rejuvenating tissues.
  
          Carboxytherapy is used to treat scars, loose skin, cellulite, dark under-eye circles, and stretch marks. People
          who undergo the procedure find an improvement in:
  
          <ul>
            <li>circulation</li>
            <li>skin elasticity</li>
            <li>fine lines and wrinkles</li>
          </ul>
          It also aids with collagen repair and the destruction of fatty deposits.
  
          Additionally, it can help reduce under-eye circles by increasing blood flow to the eyelid. Some physicians have
          also used the therapy to treat erectile dysfunction, acute arthritis, Raynaud’s syndrome, and alopecia caused by
          poor blood circulation.
  
          For fat and cellulite reduction, the procedure is often preferred over more invasive and high-risk methods, like
          liposuction. It can treat different parts of the face & body skin and cellulite.
  
  <br>
          <b>CELL THERAPY</b><br>
          Platelet-rich plasma consists of two elements: plasma, or the liquid portion of blood, and platelets, a type of
          blood cell that plays an important role in healing throughout the body. Platelets are well-known for their
          clotting abilities, but they also contain growth factors that can trigger cell reproduction and stimulate tissue
          regeneration or healing in the treated area. Platelet-rich plasma is simply blood that contains more platelets
          than normal.
  
          To create platelet-rich plasma, clinicians take a blood sample from the patient and place it into a device
          called a centrifuge that rapidly spins the sample, separating out the other components of the blood from the
          platelets and concentrating them within the plasma.
  
          The mechanism behind PRP injections is not completely understood. Studies show that the increased concentration
          of growth factors in platelet-rich plasma may stimulate or speed up the healing process and speed up baby skin
          to be mature and differentiate in to new skin and that will help to repair and rejuvenate the skin and other
          body parts. For aesthetic treatments, It can be used as rejuvenation skin treatment or can be also combined with
          other treatments for skin problems that needs repairing like scarring and aging problems.
  
          A PRP injection is a low-risk procedure and does not usually cause major side effects. The procedure involves a
          blood draw, so you should make sure you are hydrated and have eaten beforehand to prevent feeling lightheaded.
          After the procedure, you may experience some soreness and bruising at the injection site.
  
          Because PRP injections are made up of your own cells and plasma, the risk of an allergic reaction is much lower
          than with other injectable medications.
  <br>
          <b>MICRODERMABBRASION</b>
  <br>
          It is a skin rejuvenation procedure that helps you to fight the unwanted effects of aging. It may also replace a
          day in spa by its result. Some of the high-tech skin products need to penetrate deeply into your skin. So, they
          stimulate the process of building collagen by your body. Our treatment involves the usage of manual exfoliation
          to remove an outer layer of the skin. A series of this cosmetic procedures is enough to achieve the best effect.
          A unique and miraculous diamond tipped wand cleans the skin surface, make it toned and soft.
  
          The entire process of microdermabrasion procedure takes about 30 minutes. This treatment helps to reduce the
          face wrinkles, minimize the pores and diminish sun damage, making skin texture smoother. Microdermabrasion also
          provides toning and firming of your complexion by boosting up the collagen production. We can achieve even
          bigger outcome due to combining the procedure with different kinds of chemical peel.
  
          <br>
          The Diamond Microdermabrasion treatment involves following steps:
  
          <ul>
            <li>Cleansing in an appropriate way depending on your individual skin condition and type;</li>
            <li>Using the microdermabrasion wand over skin in a smooth fashion;</li>
            <li>Applying a special hydrating mask on the toned face cover;</li>
            <li>Gentle massage;</li>

          <b>SKIN MICRO-NEEDLING RADIOFREQUENCY</b><br>
          A unique and emerging facial rejuvenation option that uses either a RF machine or dermal puncture with radio
          frequency to impart micro perforations on the skin. This improves the appearance pigmentations, wrinkles, scars,
          pores, stretchmarks and uneven skin tone and results in a smoother, firmer and younger looking skin.
  
          How does Fractional Radiofrequency (RF) for skin rejuvenation work?
  
          A specialized portable hand piece with micro-pins is used to penetrate the skin. Radiofrequency then flows
          through the pins to deliver thermal energy to deeper layers of the skin promoting the body’s natural healing
          process. It works exclusively in the target areas, emitting energy to minimally ablate the skin and heat it spot
          by spot without affecting the surrounding areas. These actions stimulate the production of new collagen and
          generally improve any blemishes or pigmentation and address texture concerns.
  
          Is the treatment painful? Is it safe? How long will the treatment take?
  
          You will feel the heat and the treatment may not be comfortable but not necessarily painful. When requested, a
          topical anesthesia is applied to ensure safety and comfort throughout the procedure. Fractional Radiofrequency
          usually takes between 20-45 minutes, depending in the treatment area.
  
  
  
          How many treatments I need before I see results and how long will it stay?
  
  
  
          Immediate rejuvenation is observed after the treatment and is expected to get better in the next few days. We
          recommend 3-6 treatments with 4 weeks interval.
